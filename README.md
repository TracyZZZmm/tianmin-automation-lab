# 🌐 Tianmin Zhang – Security Automation Portfolio

This repository demonstrates **end-to-end automation workflows** for security and compliance operations — connecting **Slack**, **Jira Service Management**, **Google Apps Script**, **Looker Studio**, and **Hugging Face API**.  

It showcases how to automate **request triage**, **SLA tracking**, and **audit analytics**, turning manual review processes into intelligent, measurable systems.

## 🎯 Problem This Project Solves

Security and compliance reviews in enterprise environments are often **slow, manual, and fragmented**, requests come through Slack or email, approvals happen in Jira, and reporting is done in spreadsheets.  
This fragmentation leads to:
- Delayed responses and SLA breaches  
- Repeated manual data entry  
- Lack of centralized visibility and accountability  

Inspired by real conversations with security leads, this project directly addresses pain points such as:
- **Disorganized requests:** Slack AI Agent captures and classifies requests instantly.  
- **Unstructured approvals:** Jira workflows enforce data completeness and standardized formats.  
- **No SLA tracking:** SLA rules in Jira + Looker dashboards make compliance measurable.  
- **No unified reporting:** Google Sheets + Looker Studio generate live compliance metrics.  
- **Knowledge fragmentation:** Hugging Face NLP enables intelligent FAQs and intent detection.

Together, these integrations transform ad-hoc reviews into a **traceable, data-driven automation system**.

## ⏱️ Efficiency Impact (with Benchmarks)

According to industry statistics — from Zendesk, Freshworks (Freshdesk), and HDI/MetricNet — the average handle time (AHT) for support tickets ranges across **~3 to 10 minutes per case**:

- Zendesk: reports a “good” AHT around ~6 minutes, with sector ranges from ~3–4 min (retail) to ~8–10 min (technical support).  
  Source: [Average Handle Time – Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.co.uk/blog/average-handle-time/)
- Freshworks (Freshdesk): summarises AHT definitions and sector benchmarks around the ~5-minute magnitude.  
  Source: [Average Handle Time – Freshworks](https://www.freshworks.com/customer-service/average-handle-time/)
- HDI/MetricNet: average ticket handle time ~8.6 minutes.  
  Source: [Ticket Handle Time – Metric of the Month, HDI](https://www.thinkhdi.com/library/supportworld/2019/metric-of-month-ticket-handle-time)

In the context of request triage and structured data entry (rather than full troubleshooting), using a conservative baseline of **~4.5 minutes per request** is reasonable.

With this automation framework:  
- **Before:** ~4.5 minutes per request (manual triage + data entry)  
- **After:** **<1 minute** per request (Slack agent → structured fields → auto-log)  
- **Time saved:** ~70% per request.  

If the team processes **40 requests per week**, that equates to ~144 minutes saved weekly (~2.4 hours/week); over a 50-week year, that’s **~150+ hours (~19 workdays)** returned to the team.

## 🚀 Evolution & Strategic Impact

This system already delivers an **end-to-end automation pipeline** that eliminates manual triage and improves SLA visibility for security teams.  
Beyond the current scope, it’s designed as a **scalable architecture** ready for deeper intelligence and enterprise integration.

| Capability | Delivered | Strategic Extension |
|-------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Request Automation** | Slack → Google Sheet → Jira | Extend to REST API-based auto-ticket creation |
| **Intent Understanding** | Hugging Face model for basic classification | Fine-tune for multilingual & contextual detection |
| **SLA Visibility** | Jira metrics visualized in Looker Studio | Add anomaly alerts and predictive analytics |
| **Audit Traceability** | Logged via Google Sheets | Migrate to centralized data lake for compliance reporting |

> Rather than a prototype, this is a **production-ready blueprint** that demonstrates how automation can reduce operational friction, improve traceability, and accelerate security decision-making.
